🔍 Traffic Analysis with Wireshark
Welcome! This guide helps you "see the invisible" by analyzing the data flowing through your network. 🌐

🌟 Why This Matters
Right now, your devices are constantly talking to servers in the background. Cybersecurity pros use Traffic Analysis to watch these silent conversations, allowing them to spot suspicious activity or data leaks. 🕵️‍♂️

📦 Every Network Has a Story
Computers don't send one big file; they break data into tiny pieces called packets. 🧩 Each packet tells us:

Who sent it and who receives it (IP Addresses). 📍

What kind of message it is (Protocols). 💬

What data is inside. 📄

🔬 Wireshark: The Network Microscope
Think of Wireshark as a microscope for your internet connection. It captures packets and displays them in a way humans can read. 🔍

With Wireshark, you can:

Watch a website request happen in real-time. ⚡

See "name lookups" (DNS) as your computer finds an address. 📖

Observe how connections start and end (Handshakes). 🤝

🧠 Defending Against Attackers
Attackers try to hide their tracks inside normal-looking traffic. By learning to read these patterns, you can catch:

Scanning: Someone looking for weak spots. 🔎

Exfiltration: Secret data being sent out of the network. 📤

Redirections: Your computer being sent to a fake website. 🛑

🛠️ What We Will Do
In this session, you will get hands-on experience:

Capture live traffic on your own machine. ⏺️

Filter results to find only the important messages. 🧹

Inspect how your browser talks to a web server. 🌐
