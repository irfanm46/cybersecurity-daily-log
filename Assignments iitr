Subjective Question: Network Architecture and Trust-Based Vulnerabilities
Scenario
A company experiences repeated internal network attacks where employees report:

Sudden internet slowdowns inside the office
Occasional redirection to fake login pages
Unknown analysis reveals abnormal ARP table changes and unusual routing behavior

##Part 1: Architectural Understanding
How the layered architecture helps security analysis

The OSI / TCP-IP layered model breaks networking into logical layers, each with clearly defined responsibilities. From a security perspective, this is powerful because it allows analysts to:

Isolate problems to a specific layer (e.g., link-layer vs. network-layer attacks)

Avoid false assumptions (e.g., “no malware” does not imply “no attack”)

Map symptoms to protocol behavior (e.g., ARP tables → Layer 2)

Apply targeted controls without redesigning the entire system

Rather than treating the network as a black box, the model lets defenders reason: “Which layer is being abused, and why does that layer trust peers?”

Layers most relevant to the reported issue

The symptoms strongly indicate problems at Layer 2 and Layer 3.

Layer 2 (Data Link Layer)

Relevant because:

Abnormal ARP table changes are explicitly observed

ARP operates at Layer 2

Ethernet assumes devices on the local network are honest

Layer 2 explains:

Traffic interception

Local man-in-the-middle attacks

Sudden internal slowdowns due to packet forwarding through an attacker

Layer 3 (Network Layer)

Relevant because:

Unusual routing behavior is detected

IP routing and packet forwarding happen at Layer 3

Trust is placed in routing information and IP addresses

Layer 3 explains:

Traffic redirection

IP spoofing

Route manipulation or rogue gateways

Together, these layers form the foundation of internal network trust—and that trust is being exploited.

Part 2: Trust Assumptions and Vulnerabilities
ARP spoofing and Layer 2 trust assumptions

ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) maps IP addresses to MAC addresses.

Trust assumption:

Any device can reply to an ARP request, and replies are assumed to be truthful.

Why this is vulnerable:

ARP has no authentication

Hosts overwrite ARP cache entries blindly

An attacker can claim:
“I am the gateway” or “I am the server”

Result:

Victim sends traffic to the attacker’s MAC address

Attacker silently forwards traffic to the real destination

This enables transparent man-in-the-middle attacks without malware.

IP spoofing / route manipulation and Layer 3 trust assumptions

Layer 3 protocols (IP, routing protocols) assume that:

Source IP addresses are genuine

Routing updates come from trusted peers

Internal networks are cooperative environments

Why this is vulnerable:

IP has no built-in sender authentication

Many routing protocols prioritize reachability over verification

Attackers can:

Spoof source IPs

Advertise fake routes

Present themselves as default gateways

Result:

Traffic is redirected

Legitimate paths are bypassed

Attackers gain visibility or control over flows

How these weaknesses lead to real attacks
Weakness	Outcome
ARP spoofing	Man-in-the-middle interception
Rogue routing	Traffic redirection
MITM position	Credential harvesting
Fake login pages	Phishing without malware

Once attackers sit between users and services:

HTTPS downgrade or captive-portal style attacks become possible

Credentials are captured even in “trusted” internal environments

Part 3: Applying Security Reasoning

The goal is to reduce risk without redesigning the internet—so we add controls, not new protocols.

Control 1: Dynamic ARP Inspection (DAI)

Layer protected: Layer 2 (Data Link)

How it mitigates trust issues:

Switch validates ARP replies against trusted bindings (e.g., DHCP snooping tables)

Unauthorized ARP replies are dropped

Security benefit:

Prevents ARP spoofing

Blocks MITM attacks at the first hop

Restores trust boundaries inside the LAN

Control 2: Network Segmentation and VLAN Isolation

Layer protected: Layer 2 / Layer 3 boundary

How it mitigates trust issues:

Reduces broadcast domain size

Limits who can see or respond to ARP requests

Separates sensitive systems from general users

Security benefit:

ARP spoofing impact is localized

Attackers cannot easily reach high-value targets

Internal attacks become noisier and more detectable

Control 3: Encrypted and Authenticated Application Traffic (TLS, Mutual Auth)

Layer protected: Layer 7 (Application Layer)

How it mitigates trust issues:

Removes implicit trust in the network path

Endpoints authenticate each other cryptographically

Attackers can intercept traffic but cannot read or modify it

Security benefit:

Credential theft becomes extremely difficult

Fake login pages are detected

MITM attacks lose practical value

Final Security Insight

This scenario highlights a core principle of network security:

The internet and enterprise networks were designed for connectivity, not hostility.

Layer 2 and Layer 3 protocols assume honesty. Modern attackers exploit that assumption—not with malware, but with protocol-level deception.

Strong security does not require reinventing the stack—but it does require compensating for misplaced trust with verification, segmentation, and cryptographic assurance.
